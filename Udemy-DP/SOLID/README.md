SOLID

Single Responsibility
    Just one responsibility for class
Open-Closed 
    You can extend the class but not modify it
Liskov Subsitution
    A function that takes a base class it should be able to take a child class
Interface Segregation
    Weird one, not too relevant in JS
Dependency Inversion
    High level modules should not depend on low level modules
